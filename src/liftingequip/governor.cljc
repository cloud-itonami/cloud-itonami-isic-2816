  "Lifting Equipment Governor -- the independent compliance layer
  that earns the Lifting Equipment Advisor the right to commit. The
  LLM has no notion of design-rules law, whether a unit's own measured
  proof-load acceptance test result actually stays within its own
  recorded spec bounds, whether a load-test-detected defect against
  the unit has actually stayed unresolved, or when an act stops being
  a draft and becomes a real-world robot unit dispatch or load-test-
  certificate issuance, so this MUST be a separate system able to
  *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD -- the lifting-equipment-
  manufacturer analog of `cloud-itonami-isic-6512`'s CasualtyGovernor.

  Six checks, in priority order, ALL HARD violations: a human approver
  CANNOT override them (you don't get to approve your way past a
  fabricated design-rules spec-basis, incomplete evidence, an
  out-of-window test load, an unresolved load-test defect, or a
  double dispatch/certificate-issuance). The confidence/actuation
  gate is SOFT: it asks a human to look (low confidence / actuation),
  and the human may approve -- but see `liftingequip.phase`: for
  `:stake :actuation/dispatch-unit`/`:actuation/issue-load-test-
  certificate` (a real safety-critical act) NO phase ever allows
  auto-commit either. Two independent layers agree that actuation is
  always a human call.

    1. Spec-basis                  -- did the requirements proposal cite
                                       an OFFICIAL source (`liftingequip.
                                       facts`), or invent one?
    2. Evidence incomplete         -- for `:actuation/dispatch-
                                       unit`/`:actuation/issue-
                                       load-test-certificate`, has
                                       the unit actually been verified
                                       with a full load-test-report/
                                       material-certification-record/

                                       record/design-calculation-
                                       conformity-record evidence
                                       checklist on file?
    3. Test load out of range      -- for `:actuation/dispatch-
                                       unit`, INDEPENDENTLY
                                       recompute whether the
                                       unit's own measured
                                       proof-load acceptance test
                                       result falls outside its own
                                       recorded spec bounds
                                       (`liftingequip.registry/
                                       unit-test-load-out-of-

  above because they need no upstream comparison at all --
  `already-dispatched-violations`/`already-certified-violations`
  refuse to dispatch a unit action/issue a load-test certificate for
  the SAME unit twice, off dedicated `:unit-dispatched?`/
  `:load-test-certified?` facts (never a `:status` value) -- the SAME
